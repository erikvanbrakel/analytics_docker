# Storing metrics
The metrics collected from our systems and services are what we time series. Time series are series of data points, indexed in time order. 
As is very much in fashion nowadays, we'll want to store these time series in a data store optimized for this purpose. For this purpose, we'll
use [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/).

From their website:
> InfluxDB is an open source database written in Go specifically to handle time series data with high availability and high performance requirements. InfluxDB installs in minutes without external dependencies, yet is flexible and scalable enough for complex deployments.
